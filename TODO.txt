- Fill in the "[TODO]" in the script "veri_polyg.py"

- Unit-testing your script using small polygraphs (e.g., 1cons.polyg,
  rmw.polyg, and shared_successor.polyg). You might want to write you own "unit
  test" polygraph case.
    -- 1cons, rmw, shared_successor should pass
    -- unsat, cycle should fail

- Evaluate different encodings (tc1 and tc3, so far) on different sizes of
  polygraphs (100ndoes, 200nodes, 500nodes, and 1000nodes) and compare their
  performance.
